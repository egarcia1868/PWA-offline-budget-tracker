# PWA (Progressive Web App) - Offline Budget Tracker

https://erics-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/

A simple PWA that tracks your budget by adding/subtracting "funds" from a database.  If the user's device loses connection to the internet, this will still keep track of transactional records made on the app and update the database with the new info once connection is reestablished.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Bring up the cloned folder in your terminal and run "npm i" to install the required dependencies
3. Log in or create an account at heroku.com
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Enter info on how to create heroku app once I find an alternative to mLab !!!!!!!!!!!!
